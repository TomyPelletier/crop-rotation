# Optimizing Crop Rotation

## Introduction
This project focuses on optimizing crop rotation in Saskatchewan, Canada, a region known for its significant contribution to the country's grain production. The initiative aligns with recent Canadian government efforts to support sustainable agricultural practices, with a special emphasis on optimizing crop rotation.

## Objectives
- To develop a model that optimizes crop rotation, enhancing economic efficiency, sustainability, and environmental friendliness.
- To contribute valuable insights to the global discussion on sustainable agriculture, applicable in diverse agricultural landscapes.

## Methodology
- Utilizes data on soil nutrients, budget constraints, and botanical family considerations.
- Involves a linear and mixed-integer programming model, implemented in Python, interfacing with the Gurobi optimizer.

## Features
- Focuses on four summer crops (wheat, canola, oat, and lentils) and two winter varieties.
- Incorporates various constraints including budget availability, minimum nutrient requirements, and botanical family and adjacency considerations.
- Models over a 36-month period with a detailed analysis of soil nutrient dynamics.

## Results
- Presents a strategic planting schedule that optimizes profitability while adhering to best agricultural practices.
- Includes a comprehensive financial breakdown and an assessment of nutrient values for each plot across seasons.

## Extensions and Future Work
- Introduction of additional cover crops to diversify choices.
- Incorporation of yield uncertainty in the model to maximize minimum expected yield.
